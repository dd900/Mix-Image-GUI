# Mix-Image-GUI
A gui that helps to quickly and easily create Mix images for use with retro game front-ends.<br><br>

Pretty straight forward. All you need is the executable.<br><br>

You can download the ini file to store your own defaults if you like.<br>
Keep it in the same dir and named the same as the executable.<br>
Edit the values to your liking<br><br>

All images keep aspect when resized.<br><br>

Most of the variables are self explanatory except for "Cart Padding"<br>
This is actually the "Cart Bottom Padding" but I kept it short so the text would fit the GUI better.<br><br>

Cart is the only image that is not pinned on at least one side<br>
Screenshot is pinned Top and Centered Horizontally<br>
Box Art is pinned Bottom Left<br>
Logo is pinned Bottom Right<br><br>

Use Escape Key to close the Preview Window and change variables.<br>
You can only save if the Preview Window is open.<br><br>

Screenshot and Box are required!<br><br>

See included screenshots for more help.<br><br>


Next version will add Text as Image if no logo is present.<br>
Still have to figure out sizing on that. Some names are very long...<br>
Custom User-Defined fonts too (ttf Files).<br><br>
